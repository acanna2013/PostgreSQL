# Solutions to PostgreSQL Exercises
* The website can be found here: [PgExercises](https://pgexercises.com/)

PgExercises provides relevant problems to those learning how to query with SQL and offers the opportunity to build a strong foundation of how SQL can be used to manipulate and manage data. It provides meaningful explanations after a problem is solved and details each statements' function. I highly recommend doing these practice problems along with a lesson/book.
